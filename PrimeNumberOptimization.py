# Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves.
# The first few prime numbers are:
# 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...
# If you want all prime numbers except 2 and 3, then the list starts from:
# 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, ...
# ðŸ‘‰ In general, all primes except 2 and 3 are of the form 6k Â± 1 (where k is an integer â‰¥ 1).
# For example:
# 5 = 6Ã—1 âˆ’ 1
# 7 = 6Ã—1 + 1
# 11 = 6Ã—2 âˆ’ 1
# 13 = 6Ã—2 + 1
